NOTE: The SEASNET server for different students have different versions of g++
(even though we are both on lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu. These versions are:

      1. g++ version 
      1. g++ version

On the older version, running g++ with the -stdc++11 flag is sufficient for successful compilation.
However on the newer version, we need to link to libstdc++.so.6 (which the server doesn't do for
Shaan's lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu). Statically linking works for the server with the newer
version, but not with the older version! So we wrote a build script that would run static linking
first, and if that fails we run with the -stdc++11 flag. Please note this during the building
of this software on lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu.

We tried to solve this issue on Lab3A; however, in reflection our attempted solution would likely
not work in all cases. This version should work. We mention this in the older README, but please
keep this in consideration.

INCLUDED FILES
1. lab3b.cpp
	A C++ source module to run our program. This source code processes an input .csv file and
	searches for inconsistencies. Note that compilation should support C++11 (use of lambda
	expressions, the emplace(...) function, etc.).

2. data.h
	A C++ header file naming different structures used for data collection in the main program.
	The structs declared here include: Inode, Directory, Indirect, Group, SuperBlock, Block.

3. Makefile
	A Makefile that can be used in tandem with the make command to build (default action), build
	a debuggable version of the executable (debug target), clean the directory of created FILES
	(clean target), and create a compressed tar ball containing all files for the project.

4. README
	This file, which details included files and information on sources.

5. build.sh
	Build shell script used to build our program to support C++11. 

RESOURCES

Most generally, we used as reference cplusplus.com, which includes a lot of information
on how to use the STL and the rest of the C++ Standard Library.
