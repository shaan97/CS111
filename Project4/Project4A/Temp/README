Here is a list of the files included in this project:

1. file_transfer.png
   Here, I used a program called WinSCP to transfer a hello.c file from
   my PC to the Edison.

2. git.png
   Here I used the opkg install git command to install git (which was already
   was installed). Then I cloned a directory from one of my github accounts
   (the starter hello-world repository), and got a hello-world directory. I
   output the contents of the README to demonstrate the clone's successful.

3. hello.png
   After transfer of the hello.c file to the Edison, I use gcc to compile
   the file and run the executable, which simply prints "Hello, World!"

4. setup.png
   This shows the configuration of the Edison using the configure_edison --setup
   command (name, password, wifi).

5. selfie.jpg
   A selfie of me with the Edison. I tried not to make a weird face, but I may
   have failed.
