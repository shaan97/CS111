I would like to use 1 slip day for this project.

Included Files:
1. lab4b.c
	C source file implementing a program for an Edison who has a
temperature sensor connected to port A0 and a button connected to port D3. By
default the program prints the temperature and timestamp every second, but
takes real time and command line arguments to change functionality.

2. test.sh
	Shell script used in make check to test out the functionality of
lab4b.c program. This is the "smoke test" for this project.

3. Makefile
	Can be used in tandem with make program to build (default) the
program, make a debuggable build (debug), run a smoke test (check), create a
tar distro (dist), and remove all created files (clean).

4. README
	The file you are reading now, describing included files and use of
slip days.

to learn about useful C functions for this project, most notably strncmp(...)
and strtoken(...), used in parsing real time arguments.
