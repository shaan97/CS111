The contents of the project are as follows:

1. lab1b-client.c
   A C source file describing the program lab1b-client. It functions as a client
   making a network connection via sockets to an external process that functions
   as a client.

2. lab1b-server.c
   A C source file describing the program lab1b-server.c. It functions as a server
   making a network connection via sockets to an external process that functions
   as a client. It provides the service for the client to simulate a bash shell,
   and will accept character input, process it in the shell, and return the shell's
   output.

3. Makefile
   A file describing how to build the program and the tarball. It has distinct
   targets for client and server but by default builds both. It also supports
   clean and dist targets.

4. my.key
   This contains 16 bytes to be used as an encryption key for the encryption
   flags on the executables.

5. README
   A file describing the contents of the project.

6. crypt.h
   A C header file that encapsulates the mcrypt library into two simpler functions,
   encrypt(...) and decrypt(...). Since these are used for both client and server,
   having a header file to allow gcc to statically link those functions during
   building of the other programs would reduce time spent copy-pasting.

7. crypt.c
   A C source file that features the implementations of the encapsulated mcrypt
   library (explained in [6]).

Mcrypt: Idea of abstracting encrypt/decrypt came from TA slides on CCLE.
